                        <p>
                            <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My full name is Ivan Kristoffer M. Vestidas, and my childhood was filled with joyous moments spent with my beloved family and friends. Before delving into my childhood adventures, let me introduce my parents, Custodio and Ophelia, and my youngest brother, Miguel. One delightful memory that stands out from my childhood involves my cousin and me embarking on mini mountain-climbing escapades. We made a playful bet that the last one to descend would treat the other to a sumptuous dried mango treat. Despite my best efforts, I ended up losing the race and, to this day, owe my cousin that promised dried mango snack. My hobbies have been an integral part of my childhood, ranging from playing games and crafting to engaging in badminton and basketball. The thrill of discovering new things and learning has always captivated my curiosity.</blockquote></p>
                            <p><blockquote>My academic journey began at St. Dominic de Guzman School, where I spent my formative years up until senior high school. The nurturing environment and supportive community at the school left a lasting impact on my educational experience. When I think back on my early years, I am appreciative of all the amazing experiences I had. I can't help but feel a certain kind of nostalgia, and I frequently find myself longing that those happy times might be repeated. All of my memories—whether they involve hobbies or scaling miniature mountains—have a particular place in my heart and have shaped who I am now. I will always treasure the memories of the love and friendship I experienced with my family and friends over those years. Thats why i want to keep dreaming and look forward on my future plans.</blockquote></p>
                            <p><blockquote>Throughout my childhood, my family instilled in me values of perseverance and kindness, which have guided me through life's challenges. Every summer, my family and I would embark on memorable vacations to different destinations, creating cherished memories that I hold dear. As a child, I was fascinated by nature and spent countless hours exploring the outdoors, discovering the beauty of the world around me. I fondly remember the laughter-filled gatherings with extended family during holidays and special occasions, creating a sense of warmth and togetherness. One of the highlights of my childhood was participating in community events and volunteering, which taught me the importance of giving back to society. Reflecting on my childhood brings a sense of gratitude for the love, support, and opportunities that have shaped me into the person I am today.</blockquote></p>
